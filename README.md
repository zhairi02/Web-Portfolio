I designed this website while adhering to modern principles and current trends.

My goal was to create a simple, elegant, and functional interface that aligns with the technological and IT atmosphere.

To achieve this, I used the following technologies:

• HTML5 for structure.
• CSS3 and Bootstrap for design and responsiveness.
• JavaScript for dynamic interactions.
• PHP and MySQL for server-side functionalities, such as managing messages through the contact form.

The website stands out for its simplicity and efficiency. The colors and typography were carefully selected to provide a pleasant user experience while adhering to current standards, keeping in mind the IT theme that reflects my background.

I incorporated some advanced features inspired by well-known websites to enhance interactivity and meet modern expectations. However, I ensured that the implementation remained clear and free of excessive complexity, staying within my skill level.
